Cocostep is a port of cocos2d-iphone to GnuStep system. 

The project is still in its very basic stage. Just started.

 
Limitation: It wont support objc2 features. That means no-no for properties, FastEnumerators.. 

Final output of this project will be beautifull.

"Develop on linux -> Build on mac ->Run on iphone"
